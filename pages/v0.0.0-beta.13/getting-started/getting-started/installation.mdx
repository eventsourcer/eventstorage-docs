# Getting started with eventstorage

eventstorage is a high-performance event sourcing framework built for dotnet offering the event storage
of choice between Azure Sql database, Postgre Sql and Sql Server.


## Installation

Follow the steps below to jump start the installation and prepare the event storage infrastructure.
  <Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Install .NET 8 SDK
      
      es runs on dotnet 8 and requires the sdk installed:
      ```sh
      https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
      ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Setup dependencies
      Run mssql or pg database on docker.

      Using `docker-compose`: 
      ```sh
      docker compose --project-name eventstorage up -d
      ```
      Using `docker run` for pg:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
      ```
      Using `docker run` for mssql:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-mssql -p 1433:1433 -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=sysadmin@1234" -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
      ```
      Optionally run `Redis` for high-performance projections:
      ```sh
      docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
      ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Create a dotnet web api project
      <Steps>
      Once we have are done running needed docker dependencies, we can start setting up eventstorage.
      <Note>
        These steps are for starters and you could probably skip them if you are an experienced dotnet.
      </Note>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create your app folder `eventstorage-app` for instance then get inside of the folder and run
        `dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version=8.0.401 {:sh}` which creates `global.json` specifying net sdk version
        for your project.

        Run `dotnet --list-sdks {:sh}` to list installed sdk versions on your machine if you are not
        sure which ones you've installed.
        
        This is how a `global.json` looks like depending on your sdk version:
        ```json title="global.json" showLineNumbers
        {
          "sdk": {
            "version": "8.0.401"
          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create a solution by running `dotnet new solution -n EventStorage {:sh}` inside of the folder.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create `src` folder followed by creating a dotnet api project inside of `src` folder with
        `dotnet new webapi -n EventStorage.Api {:sh}`
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Get back to the root folder and add the api project to the solution with `dotnet sln
        EventStorage.sln add src\EventStorage.Api --in-root {:sh}`.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Finally run `dotnet build {:sh}` and it should build the solution properly.
      </Steps.Step>
      </Steps>
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Get ready to spin up an event storage!
      One last step of the installation tutorial is adding `EventStorage`
      package into our api project by running `dotnet add src\EventStorage.Api package EventStorage --prerelease {:sh}`
      in the root folder or `dotnet add package EventStorage --prerelease {:sh}` inside of api project.
    </Steps.Step>
  </Steps>
    

## What's next?

We have everything setup now and are ready to spin up our project with the library.
- Next we start developing our api and turn that into an event sourced service
with  [EventStorage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/eventstorage/readme.md) library.
